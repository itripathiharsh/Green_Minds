ðŸš€ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

Git

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/itripathiharsh/Sentiment_Analysis.git](https://github.com/itripathiharsh/Sentiment_Analysis.git)
cd Sentiment_Analysis

Create and activate a virtual environment:
This keeps your project dependencies isolated.

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install the required dependencies:
This command reads the requirements.txt file and installs all necessary Python packages.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up your environment variables:
Create a file named .env in the root of your project folder. This file will hold your secret API keys. The .gitignore file is already configured to prevent this file from being uploaded to GitHub.

Open the .env file and add your Hugging Face API token like this:

HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY="your_new_api_key_here"

Replace "your_new_api_key_here" with your actual, new Hugging Face token.

Usage
To run the application, execute the App.py script from your terminal:

python App.py

This will start the local web server. Open your web browser and navigate to the address provided in the terminal (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000 or similar) to use the application.
