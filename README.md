.
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore               # Specifies files for Git to ignore
â”œâ”€â”€ App.py                   # The main Streamlit web application
â”œâ”€â”€ Sentiment_analysis.py    # Standalone script for local, terminal-based analysis
â”œâ”€â”€ packages.txt             # System-level dependencies for Streamlit Cloud
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt         # Python dependencies for the project

Note: CSV and JSON log files are only generated when running Sentiment_analysis.py locally. The deployed app uses Firestore.

ðŸš€ Getting Started (Local Development)
Follow these instructions to run the application on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Git

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/itripathiharsh/Sentiment_Analysis.git](https://github.com/itripathiharsh/Sentiment_Analysis.git)
cd Sentiment_Analysis

Create and activate a virtual environment:

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up your environment variables:
Create a file named .env in the project root. This file will hold your secret keys. The .gitignore file is already configured to prevent this file from being uploaded to GitHub.

Open the .env file and add your Hugging Face API token:

HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY="your_actual_hf_token_here"

(Note: To run the app locally with the Firestore database, you would also need to set up a Google Cloud service account key. See the App.py file for details on the required credentials.)

Usage
To run the web application locally, execute the following command:

streamlit run App.py

Open your web browser and navigate to the local address provided (usually http://localhost:8501).
